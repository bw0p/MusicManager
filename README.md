# MusicManager
A simple music manager for renaming files and setting meta data.

Features:
1. Bulk renaming with a simple intuitive text box. 
2. Smart spacing for when you need to rename files and maintain spaces between title names but remove any extra spaces left by previous text you removed. (Toggable)

#how to run
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install mutagen
python app.py
Or I think hitting run debugging should make use of the .json (you still need an environment)

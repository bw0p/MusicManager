# MusicManager
A simple music manager for renaming files and setting meta data.
btw rn its a bit broken so erm only the renaming works as of 12/02/2026

Features:
1. Bulk renaming with a simple intuitive text box. 
2. Smart spacing for when you need to rename files and maintain spaces between title names but remove any extra spaces left by previous text you removed. (Toggable)

# How to run
I use VS Code so im not sure how this would work on other IDEs
For VS Code make sure you have the Python extension downloaded!!

```
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install mutagen
python app.py
```

Or I think hitting run debugging should make use of the .json (you still need an environment)
